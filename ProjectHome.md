The Maco government provides instant (real-time every 5 seconds) traffic status at 13 different locations on its website, which inspires and enables us to work on this project. The project requires image processing techniques, including edge detection, image recognition, etc. and probably machine learning.

The application is runnable on Windows.

The application is mainly written in C# with various techniques such as WPF, Task Parallelism. OpenCV and other libraries may be used.
